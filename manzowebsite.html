From past experiences I have faced in LPSCI, Grade 9 is one of the most memorable and challenging as of now. I have learned lots of things such as coding and recreational activities. If not for the teachers who have assisted me along the way, I wouldn't have been able to be the person who I am right now, "A person who has learned". I would like to thank the efforts of each and everyone who was with  me in this S.Y 2023-2024 to tackle the challenges we've faced along the way. And of course lets not forgot "you" who read my portfolio from start to finish!<br>
